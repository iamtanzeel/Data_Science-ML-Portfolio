# Data_Science-ML-Portfolio

The projects done in the Data Analysis uses __Python__ as programming language, libraries like __Pandas__ and __Numpy__ fro data cleaning and data manipulation and __Matplotlib__ and __Seaborn__ for Data Visualization. The ML libraries used are __scikit-learn__, __Tensorflow-Keras__, __NLTK__, __spacy__ etc. The IDE used is __Jupyter Notebook__. 

The Technical skills used in these projects include __Data Scrapping, Data wrangling, Data cleaning, EDA and Data Visualization.__

## [Project 1: CO2 Emissions from Vehicles](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/co2_emissions)

* This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. The dataset has been taken from Canada Government official open data website. This is a compiled version. This contains data over a period of 7 years.
* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles).
* Analysis was done and Linear Regression was used to train the model.

## [Project 2: Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/vehicle_isurance_fraud)

* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection).
* The project was to train a model to detect if the insurance claim is fraudlent.
* The ML model used for training was Random Forest with accuracy of 78.4%.

## [Project 3: Room Occupancy Detection](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/room_occupancy)

* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/room-occupancy-estimation-data-set).
* The projects trains a model to detect the room occupancy using sensor inputs like Temperature, Sound, CO2 etc.
* Decision Tree Classifier was used to detect the occupancy. The model has 99.21% accuracy.

## [Project 4: News Article Classification](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/news_classification)

* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset).
* The project was to train a model which classifies the article/news as World, Sports, Business and Sci/Tech.
* NLTK and Spacy were used.
* Multinomial Naive Bayes was used for classification.

## [Project 5: Footwear Classification usin Convolution Neural Network](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/footwear_classification_(CNN))

* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/shoes-classification-dataset-13k-images).
* The data consists of 13,000 images of 5 different classes of footwear.
* CNN was used and the model attained validation accuracy of 89.33% after 200 Epochs.

## [Project 6: Sentiment Analysis: Depressive Text Classification](https://github.com/iamtanzeel/Data_Science-ML-Portfolio/tree/main/depression_text_classification)

* The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/depression-reddit-cleaned).
* The dataset was scrapped from Reddit and targets mainly mental health classification.
* Various models were trained on this data, with the combination of Tf-idf and SVC giving 93% accuracy.
